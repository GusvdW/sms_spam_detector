# In this assigment I've refactoried code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. Once the model was created and trained, I created a Gradio app to host the application, enabling users to test text messages. The application will provide feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as spam or not, based on the model's performance
